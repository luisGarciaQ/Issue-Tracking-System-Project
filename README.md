# Issue-Tracking-System-Project
This issue tracker project is a ticket system that allows the user to create a ticket, give it a title, date, assign an owner, and add a description of the issue. I have created this project to test new knowledge acquired regarding Java and MySQL.

## Usage

The project has been developed mostly for personal usage and tracking self development as well as to track development of personal projects. This project allows me to create a ticket and treat it as a pending To-Do item. Each pending ticket represents a new update or feature that I need to develop and implement to my Issue Tracker System project or any other project either school related or personal.

## Technologies used

Java, Mysql.

## Project Status

Issue tracker system will be in constant development as this project will be a real time measurement of my skills and development as a programmer.
